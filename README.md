# HashMap
The Odin Project JS project to implement own hash map class.

## Hash Map Functions
*Descriptions From The Odin Project*
- hash(key) takes a key and produces a hash code with it.
- has(key) takes a key as an argument and returns true or false based on whether or not the key is in the hash map.
- remove(key) takes a key as an argument. If the given key is in the hash map, it should remove the entry with that key and return true. If the key isnâ€™t in the hash map, it should return false.
- length() returns the number of stored keys in the hash map.
- clear() removes all entries in the hash map.
- keys() returns an array containing all the keys inside the hash map.
- values() returns an array containing all the values.
- entries() returns an array that contains each key, value pair.

## Skills Used
- Write hash map data structure with ES6 class syntax
- Use private fields to control variable and method access
- Use npm to package and import linked list project

## Lessons Learned
- A reference to an object does not update when the original object gets updated

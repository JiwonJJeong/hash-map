# HashMap
The Odin Project JS project to implement own hash map class.

## Hash Map Functions
*Descriptions From [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-hashmap)*
- hash(key) takes a key and produces a hash code with it.
- has(key) takes a key as an argument and returns true or false based on whether or not the key is in the hash map.
- remove(key) takes a key as an argument. If the given key is in the hash map, it should remove the entry with that key and return true. If the key isnâ€™t in the hash map, it should return false.
- length() returns the number of stored keys in the hash map.
- clear() removes all entries in the hash map.
- keys() returns an array containing all the keys inside the hash map.
- values() returns an array containing all the values.
- entries() returns an array that contains each key, value pair.

## Achieved Learning Goals
- **Familiarity with Hash Maps**: Authored data structure and methods with ES6 class syntax from near scratch
- **Creating npm packages**: Created and imported [linked list project](https://github.com/JiwonJJeong/linked-lists) to reduce code redundancy.

## Personal Takeaways
- A reference to an object does not update when the original object gets updated
